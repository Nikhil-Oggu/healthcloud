# PROGRESS.md — HealthCloud running log

> The **diary** of the project. Updated at the end of every session (by the `/wrap` command once it
> exists, or manually). Read this + `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/PLAN.md` at the start of every session.

## Current position
- **Phase:** 0 ✅ complete · **Environment setup** ✅ complete
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Nikhil-Oggu/healthcloud (private, branch `main`)
- **Next up:** **Phase 1, slice 1** — Spring Boot 4.1 skeleton + PostgreSQL in Docker Compose,
  runnable locally with a health endpoint. Plan the slice first, then build.

## Log (newest first)

### 2026-09-12 — Phase 0 started
- Created clean repo root `~/Desktop/healthcloud` (lowercase, no space).
- Renamed `documents/` → `docs/`; source-of-truth PDF now at `docs/source-of-truth/`.
- Built full monorepo skeleton (backend/frontend/worker/infrastructure/api/docs/synthetic-data/scripts/.github).
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (rulebook), `docs/PLAN.md` (roadmap), this `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- Drafted first ADRs (001 modular monolith, 002 shared-DB multi-tenancy, 004 Cognito+BFF) + ADR template/index.
- Added `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docker-compose.yml` placeholder, OpenAPI + event-catalog stubs.
- `git init`, first commit, created **private** GitHub repo `Nikhil-Oggu/healthcloud`, pushed `main`. ✅
- Phase 0 complete.

## Environment status (2026-09-12) — ALL READY ✅
- ✅ Git, GitHub CLI (logged in as `Nikhil-Oggu`), VS Code, git identity.
- ✅ Java `25.0.4` (Homebrew `openjdk@25`), `javac` 25 — JAVA_HOME + PATH set in `~/.zshrc`.
- ✅ Node `24.21.0` (Homebrew `node@24`) + npm `11.19` — on PATH via `~/.zshrc`.
- ✅ Docker Desktop: daemon running (v29.7.2, aarch64), `hello-world` container ran; Compose v5.5.1.
- Maven: not global — using the per-project Maven wrapper (`mvnw`) instead, per baseline.
- Note: `~/.zshrc` created with a `HealthCloud dev env` block (openjdk@25 + node@24 on PATH); Docker Desktop appended its CLI-completions block.
